My work in the course: Harvard CS50 - Intro To Computer Science
I used **GitHub Codespaces** to write all of my code for this course because it's easier to stay organized and track everything in one place. After finishing each project, I copied the final version into **CS50.dev** to run and submit it using `submit50`.
This setup helped me keep a clean record of my work while still following CS50â€™s submission rules.
